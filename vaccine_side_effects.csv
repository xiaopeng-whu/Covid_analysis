1- After watching Dope Sick and independently digging into “big pharma” I have a lot of questions for Pharmaceutical CO’s , NIH, CDC, FDA and Gov officials. What kind of $ grab is this? #Pfizer made roundup, Gov agencies approved it, #Pfizer also makes the chemo to treat those	Pfizer	Neutral	None
I literally had a mild temp for a day - sleepless night - a mild cold for 3 days. Got it post vaccine. I’ve been double vaxxed and the second Jab made me feel worse than the coof. The AstraZeneca vax is more conventional so suppose it takes edge off	AstraZeneca	Neutral	Tiredness,Chills
After a lovely day with only some pain in the vaccination arm at night, I woke up this morning at 5, because everything hurts. Can't cancel today's online session so hope paracetamol and a bevvy of vitamins will power me through. #covidvaccine #PfizerVaccine	Pfizer	Neutral	Muscle Pain
I too had two Moderna shots a booster of Pfizer recently, had chest pain for 3 weeks after my booster. I tested positive for COVID yesterday, went to the ER to got some antibodies & then to the pharmacy to get some steroids, an inhaler & cough suppressant. Chest X-ray is clear.

I had my second Astra Zeneca vaccine shot yesterday. No side effects, nor were there with the first shot. I do feel a bit tired though today (yawning), but that might be just my habitual insomnia. This is frustrating because I can't milk it for TLC!	AstraZeneca	Neutral	Tiredness
Incoherent. Bill Gates' approach has led to dozens of viable vaccine candidates at a range of prices available worldwide. OTOH, China state-sponsored approach with Sinovac put all eggs in one basket with only 50% success rate. Absurd to claim current shortages are due to IP law.	Sinovac	Neutral	None
As a retired GP, aged 71 and half vaccinated with AZ, I would strongly advise anyone young to WAIT FOR PFIZER because you have very low risk of dying from Covid, and a real risk from AZ. A tough one, and all because our PM stuffed up vaccine supplies.	Pfizer	Positive	None

It’s keeping big pharma fed for election time, all ya have to do is follow the money. The owner of Pfizer is a veterinarian and Dr. Malone who created the MRNA’s for the jab was shut down on Twitter and censored, tells you everything!	Pfizer	Negative	None
Pfizer and moderna have like 95% of efficacy, It means that if you get covid, there is a 95% chance of you barely getting sick. All vaccines prevent going to the hospital, sorry 4 my bad english :)	Pfizer	Positive	None

The MB government can shove their COVID-19 Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Moderna vaccines where the sun don't shine. It's either Pfizer WITH A GUARANTEED SECOND DOSE IN 30 DAYS or nothing. I'm tired of them screwing with playing bureaucratic games against maker instructions!	Pfizer	Neutral	None

Side effects of the Pfizer vaccine tend to appear more intensely in the second dose too :/.

Double Moderna -1st dose : very marked pain in the arm (like no other vaccination) - 2nd dose : fever (39C) and severe flu like symptoms for 24h and dizziness up to 72h. Nothing alarming so far but clearly the most unpleasant experience in terms of vaccines I ever had.	Moderna		Tiredness,Muscle Pain,Fever
So Astra zenica is causing blood clots I wonder how many had stacked up on pain killers before the shot. Honestly that is more dangerous than the vaccine and you won't know if you actually get side effects. #COVIDVaccination AstraZeneca #COVID19	AstraZeneca	Neutral	Swelling
I don't get the flu vaccine either. Never had it. My friend had severe pain immediately after 2nd Pfizer. Didn't go to doc just felt it would pass His pain suddenly stopped on the 14th b4 bed. He went to sleep and died in the middle of the night on April 15th	Pfizer	Neutral	Muscle Pain
A big F no! I had to get moderna for my second jab as I was forced to by my job and I'm in bed with severe flu like symptoms. Almost everyone I have talked to who got boosted with moderna were bed ridden for days. I haven't been sick in 2 effing years and now I am. Eff them.	Moderna	Neutral	Nausea

No one is not being open & forthcoming about the possible side effects from the vaccine. I had a sore arm after Moderna #1, nothing after #2. Tetanus shots cause more side effects. I've heard the Shingles vaccine causes pretty bad side effects - are you going after that too?	Moderna	Neutral	Muscle Pain

Solid. And agree that I’ve never reacted to a vaccine like that before. All three shots. My youngest had 5 vaxx shots the week before and nothing. But Pfizer made her feverish. I’ve assumed it’s because it’s a more effective technology. We’ve been improving vaxx since 1796.	Pfizer	Positive	Fever
On a side note, I took the Astra-Zeneca vaccine, and have been documenting my body's progress for the parents of my library to show them that it's okay.

The Moderna booster is only lasting 15 weeks and you want to mandate us to put these experimental chemicals in our body. Omicron is just as strong as a regular cold. So with only 15 weeks of immunity by the booster you might mandate us around 4 shots a year? No thanks	Moderna	Negative	Other
I felt worse after the first shot but had a fever for longer after the second. Had AstraZeneca for my vaccine. People I know who got Pfizer said that the second was rough. Was worse (Pfizer) if you’d already had covid before 2nd bc stronger immune response	Moderna	Neutral	Fever

The real number is probably 35% If you only received one shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine and refused to go back, or never had any vaccination that drops it from 70% It never reached 70% if there's a large population of people throughout the state who refuse to take it.	Pfizer	Neutral	None

Yeah, Bro. However, we all react to the vaccine differently. I didn't experience so much ache at the injected spot. What I experienced was severe head/eye ache, with fever.

Oh hey, I got vaccinated too (Pfizer, you know, the good one) and was still was wearing a mask in public. I still got the delta variant bc the vaccine is only like 60% effective against it. I have been pretty sick for the last 2 weeks. Good luck out there with that attitude.	Pfizer	Positive	None

I want to clarify when I had the AstraZeneca vaccine my vision was impaired 2 months later I have severe pain in and around my eyes like acid being thrown in my eyes as well as tounge pain like burning of the tounge, I have regained some of my vision so the issue is mainly pain	AstraZeneca	Negative	Other

Recieved my dose of Pfizer vaccine, waiting for 15 mins ... became dizzy, some tears came aswell a feeling of nonessential and awe struck Aith goosebumps and hairs standing on my neck with the odd shout from me, then the nurs told me to stop watching the #BATTLEFIELD2042 trailer	Pfizer	Neutral	Nausea

The only side effect I had with the Pfizer vaccine was a sore arm at the sight of the injections. But a slight headache and a dazed feeling is pretty normal. Get plenty of rest and you should be good to go in a few days. Thank you for getting vaccinated!	Pfizer	Positive	Muscle Pain,Nausea

You’ve got this! I just got my first Pfizer stick today. I’ve used it as an excuse to slow down, put PJs on, and snuggle up. Little muscle sore and sleepy, but that’s it. Good luck!	Pfizer	Positive	Tiredness,Muscle Pain
My daughter got both shots of the Pfizer a few months ago, and she also got covid again. She was sick for 3 weeks, but thankfully, didn't have to be hospitalized thanks to the vaccine. Glad you are doing better	Pfizer	Positive	
i got both doses of the pfizer vaccine, it's honestly not that bad. the thing with shots is that if you tense up your muscles too much, it'll hurt more than if you don't. the second dose gave me a fever for a day, but that's normal because your body is just protecting itself.

Pfizer booster for me and just a sore arm for the day. I was hoping to regrow my hair but so far, no such luck.	Pfizer	Positive	Muscle Pain

I’m 22, fully vaccinated (Moderna) at the time, Delta, and I had tachycardia (increased heart rate) slightly during infection that got worse 1-2 months after recovering. My heart was averaging 110-130 beats, it felt like I couldn’t breath and I would get dizzy when I stood up	Moderna	Negative	Other
My Pfizer vaccine felt like a mosquito bite for like half a second. The place of injection was a little sore afterwards but it wasn’t too bad at all! Most effects I believe was due to anxiety- all sensations became stronger	Pfizer	Positive	Muscle Pain
Was in two minds on posting this (don’t want to put people off having a vaccine) BUT on balance I think it best to check. How common is dizziness a day or two after the Moderna jab? Have read others have cut caffeine to ease the symptoms? Thoughts anyone?	Moderna	Negative	Nausea
What's your course? I was J/J and then Moderna. I felt far more ill effects from Moderna booster than the original J/J. Had about 24 hours of aches and fatigue.	Moderna	Neutral	Muscle Pain,Nausea
Got the second dosage of the Moderna vaccine. I feel like a truck, boat and a plane hit me all at the same time. Fever at 40, Chills, nauseas, dizziness… Is this vaccine for humans, or rats?	Moderna	Negative	Muscle Pain,Chills,Fever,Nausea
More than a month ago me and my whole family taken vaccine AstraZeneca because we are doctors (frontliners) we are injected at 1PM, they took Paracetamol 6 hours before sleeping at night and felt nothing i forgot to drink mine and i had like sore muscle feeling, dizzyness...

I had J&J and then Moderna booster. felt fine for the day (got it in the morning) but at night started experiencing side effects.

I got my final dose of the moderna vaccine on the 17 of May, got home & immediately went to bed I wasn’t having any side effects then, I was just tired from having to get up. But, when I woke up my arm was sore asf & I felt AWFUL. Aches, and I ran a fever throughout the day.	Moderna	Negative	Tiredness,Fever
I had Pfizer too and my arm was really sore. I'd definitely say take some paracetamol tonight and possibly tomorrow too.	Pfizer	Negative	Muscle Pain

Thank you. They both had covid in July. I stayed away & am 3Xs Moderna. I have not had covid yet. My daughter has had shingles 2xs since covid and still has no sense of taste or smell. She is 28. I put it all in Gods hands cause I’m too tired of it. I do blame trump a lot.	Moderna	Negative	Other

Yeah as lizi said, some cold and flu or paracetamol before you go and keep taking as directed. The vaccine itself wasn't sore and was over really quickly.

I’ll add my house experience: Triple Pfizer here w/ triple Moderna wife. We haven’t had Covid (knocks very hard on all wood services). Pfizer no side effects (normal for me-anesthesia doesn’t work sometimes). Moderna destroyed wife (also normal - flu shots make her sick).	Pfizer	Positive

Today, I tested positive for COVID-19. I have very mild symptoms that started yesterday- mainly just fatigue/a sore throat.

As an elementary music teacher in Texas who took the J&J vaccine in March, I took my 1 Pfizer “booster” because teachers start work 1st week of August. I can’t wait for CDC/FDA to decide because my school district isn’t. It’s all connected.	Pfizer	Positive	
two days after my first moderna shot and I'm feeling totally fine (okay, I'm pretty tired but I think that's because of my chronic illness and not the vaccine) the main side effect I experienced was a sore arm but that's totally fine now, also had a sore throat yesterday	Moderna	Positive	
I have a lot of friends that are adamant about not getting the vaccine and one quit her job over it. I got the Moderna. It makes you a little sick on the second shot. It's not so terrible. I was going to wait to but I had to get it to see my Granddaughter.	Moderna	Positive

I’ll be eligible for my booster in a few weeks. I’ve had two Pfizer and 12-hour fever each time (not bad but enough to be stuck in bed). Any intel on whether getting the same or different for third dose makes a difference for efficacy or side effects? Google says “not really”.	Pfizer	Positive	Fever
1st- J&J - chills for a little while, 101° fever for probably about 12 hours. Sore arm for like 4-5 days. Booster- Moderna - Same effects although the fever lasted for a little longer.

I had side effects (flu-like symptoms) from my first Pfizer jab. Had none at all from my second. Also had an ache in my arm at the vaccination site after both, but I don't think that's a side effect of the vaccine, more like one from having a needle shoved in my arm.	Pfizer	Positive	Headache,Fever
So I got my booster on Monday (arm’s still sore, but I’m mostly fine). is getting here today. What I’ve learned is that a lot fewer people get the Moderna vax.	Moderna	Positive	Muscle Pain

Even though I'm fully vaxxed #Moderna, the Delta variant is scary. It's back to masks in busy retail stores. People are sick and dying, esp. in Trump/vaccine hesitancy states. It's also spooking the markets. I might retire in 3 years. I need a healthy 401(k). And I dabble, too.	Moderna	Neutral	None
I'm triple jabbed, three Pfizer shots. A bit of a sore arm with the first two not even that with the third.	Pfizer	Neutral	Muscle Pain
I hate needles - HATE - but, I barely felt it! My arm was sore for about 3 days (had Moderna) and I was tired the next day. It was a weekend and thankfully I could rest. Process was smooth as better... sign in, show health card, wait a min, then post vaccine wait 15 min and go!	Moderna	Neutral	Tiredness,Muscle Pain

Vaccine update for those who are interested. I had my first Pfizer shot on Friday. No Covid symptoms at all, just a really sore arm on Saturday and I was a bit ‘pap’ all weekend, but I spent most of the weekend on my couch and today I’m pretty much back to normal.	Pfizer	Positive	Muscle Pain
Yes, had Pfizer booster a week before catching it. Was pretty sick for about a week, and now only just getting over it.	Pfizer	Positive	No Details
Hi Sarah :) I got the Moderna vaccine, it was just a little pinch for the actual injection and then I just had some arm pain for ~2 days. Good luck, you got this!	Moderna	Positive	Muscle Pain
Pfizer Booster might as well have been a water injection for all the effect it had on anyone in my family and friends. Two of us felt tired about 2 hours after the injection and that was it. We all had a little tenderness at injection site but that’s the same for any vaccination	Pfizer	Positive	Tiredness
I got my 2nd dose of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine yesterday. It feels good to have it done. Fortunately the only side effect is a sore arm, which is already feeling better, and didn’t get as sore as it did after the first shot.	Pfizer	Positive	Muscle Pain

I got the Moderna vaccine. I didn’t really have any side-effects other than feeling run down the day after the second dose. My wife had the fatigue and not feeling great side-effects.	Moderna	Positive	Tiredness
I just turned 50. I had a history of obesity, high blood pressure, smoked for 20 years, but got extremely healthy in my early 40s, and really never fell off the wagon.

NO! I said weeks ago I hope they don't think we're having a ruddy cocktail of stuff when 'flu jabs come around. I don't want it all at once & I reckon I won't be the only one.

I got the moderna & from what I’ve heard from other people regardless of which one you get the first one isn’t as bad as the second. I felt sick with the first one but the second one I couldn’t get up & do anything at all. But it didn’t last long. It depends on your body.	Moderna	Neutral	No Details
I always have funky reactions to vaccines. With my first Moderna shot I had an elevated heart rate and they held me for about an hour until it came back down.

Absolute disgrace. No kid or anyone under the age of 60 even needed a vaccine. Even those over 60 had a 99.97% survival rate before the vaccines even existed. What does Pfizer care, they're never going to held liable and make billions. For what is essentially the cold.	Pfizer	Negative	None

It’s not coincidence in my case , it’s a vaccine side effect that Pfizer probably is keeping secret, like they did with myocarditis (I have advanced degree in Biology, I know about statistics and causation-correlation, in my case it is muscle pain in LB caused by the shot)	Pfizer	Negative	Other

Actually, it’s more math. If your Moderna was 70% effective in a pool of 100 exposed that’s 30 hospitalized. If it drops to 70% effective with a new, more contagious variant that exposes 400, that’s 120 hospitalized. Same vax effectiveness. More sick.	Moderna	Negative	No Details

The main point for vaccines is for you to not get sick. AZ is at 60% for that point. The Delta variant is more transmissible and causes more serious symptoms. If AZ is the only choice, sure go for it. If the choice is between AZ, Moderna, or Pfizer. IMHO don't go with AZ.	Pfizer	Positive	None

Damn that sucks. I had chicken pox as an adult and it came with shingles type burning around my waist. So I got the vaccine 2 years ago. After I got my second Moderna shot in May, I had fever and weakness and I swear some shingles pain on a small area of my waist.	Moderna	Negative	Redness,Fever,Other
Thanks for setting up 5 more vaccine center in selangor...but frankly it's not enough...sinovac has 70% efficacy, which means that even if vaccinate 100%, 30% will still fall sick...can we think beyond vaccinations for new norm? Counting on u pls	Sinovac	Neutral	None
Just as an aside my husband got the Moderna vaccine on Sunday, first dose, and has been totally fine. Arm is sore and he *thinks* he's feeling a little tired but other than that nothing. Not many people seem to be getting Moderna, so thought I'd mention it to reassure.	Moderna	Positive	Tiredness,Muscle Pain
I have the J&J and Moderna booster, always wear a mask and had someone close very sick, went to test and I’m positive. The person won’t test themself and thinks I gave it to them. This is like living a nightmare with morons around me.	Moderna	Neutral	None
Nobody knows how the PCR tests are being carried out. My daughter just had he Sinovac jab yesterday and this morning not feeling well with fever. I'm praying she will get better. Regards	Sinovac	Neutral	Fever
Don't care. I am working hard not to pay a bit of attention to him. On important things, I have a fever after Moderna yesterday. Just be prepared	Moderna	Neutral	Fever
My strategy for encouraging my patients to get the vaccine is just me talking about my experience of getting the vaccines. Telling them that I had fears, doubt too. Why I encouraged my parents to have the jab kahit Sinovac. It's much chill to have a conversation.	Sinovac	Positive	None
I’m 72 years old, had both moderna vaccinines and the booster, haven’t been sick 1 day, I’m sure everyone is different.	Moderna	Neutral	None

My husband & I both had Moderna. He had a sore arm. I had the same after the 1st one but I got very sick after the 2nd one which lasted 36 hours.

I got both the shots of Pfizer vaccine, and I did not fall sick or experienced any symptom after the shots. I was perfectly fine. It's to be noted that I don't have any other comorbidity; I was working out (in a good shape) at that time. I also took my doctor's advice beforehand.	Pfizer	Positive	None
We both got Moderna. Our first was Pfizer and then I got Moderna for my second (it was supposed to be Pfizer but Ford ...). So I am P, M, M and my husband is P, P, M. We are both very happy and feel terrific today. Sore arm, that is all.	Pfizer	Positive	Muscle Pain

You may have a bad couple of days - I did after my first jab - but you’ll be fine. I had AZ for the first two, then a Moderna booster. It gave me a sore arm for a day or two.

You might need what Israel is doing in a second booster then. Idk the rules about JnJ but Moderna wrecked me for 1 day then I’ve felt better and better every day for the last month. It’s like it’s fighting the common cold too. Way less sniffles than 2018/19	Moderna	Positive	None

Isn’t VAERS unreliable? How do we know how over or under reported these things are? My father was also in the ER with severe abdominal pain 5 days after his Pfizer shot- Gallbladder. He didn’t report bc he didn’t want to bother with paperwork. That has to be pretty common	Pfizer	Negative	Other

Actually, I don't think that's entirely accurate. The Pfizer booster is same dosage as each of the first two shots. The Moderna is one half the amount of the first two. Either way, it's possible to have side effects. I was really tired for a day. Slept it off and felt fine.	Pfizer	Negative	Tiredness,No Details

I got boosted on Dec 25. Moderna (all 3). Half of the regular shot, my shoulder was a little sore for about 3 days (about 20% as much discomfort as either of the first two shots were for me).

Ok so, pfizer vaccine side effects the day after : My arm hurts way more than shot 1. Way more. It's bearable, but it hurts to lift my arm. Also I think I am a fraction warmer.

Not sure if it was related or not. I took a decongestant and was fine after 3 days.	Moderna	Neutral	Tiredness,Other
yung friend ko may covid ngayon. Sabi nya,sipon lang daw. No fever and still with sense of smell and taste. No pains .Sabi ng doc. nya, since he have booster shot (moderna), nothing to worry daw. Hindi nga daw sya pinapainom ng antibiotic. Pero syempre, kinakabahan pa din sya	Moderna	Neutral	None
Second jab yesterday (Astra Zeneca) and apart from tiredness and my arm every so often piping in with ‘hey, you remember that I HURT right?’ I’m feeling mostly ok. No way to tell if the tiredness is the vaccine or the usual crap (I left the house two days in a row). #NEISvoid	AstraZeneca	Positive	Tiredness,Muscle Pain
My Recently Boosted Friend told me he was not aware about serious heart side effects with the vaccine. Learned about it via podcast with Dr Malone. Told me he had to quit running due to chest pain after Dose 2 Moderna. Didn't know why. Never sought treatment.	Moderna	Negative	Other
I already got both doses of the Astrazeneca vaccine. I had terrible side effects (all the things they listed - fever, slow heartbeat, exhaustion... )on my first dose so make sure you drink a lot of water and rest a lot as well. on my second dose, it wasn't as bad as the first &lt;3	AstraZeneca	Negative	Tiredness,Fever,Other
find it funny that my mum had the pfizer and got so sick from covid for a whole ass week, dad had the astrazeneca and was only sick for a day. i had the moderna, a vax i knew absolutely nothing about (only that it was similar to pfizer) and when i had covid i felt next to nothing	AstraZeneca	Positive	No Details
My booster left me wirh a sore arm and that's it. Though I don't think that's common. And my previous Moderna doses hit me much harder	Moderna	Positive	Muscle Pain
Got my COVID vaccine booster (Moderna) a couple of days ago. Felt a little more feverish than last times (Pfizer), but was back to normal after about a day and a half.	Moderna	Neutral	Fever
Time. It hasn't been enough time. It takes years (sometimes a decade) to gather enough data to say a drug or vaccine is safe.

I got the Pfizer vaccine, March 5th and March 26th. With the first vaccine, I had a sore arm for a couple days and I remember waking up the following morning with a nasty headache.

Mixing Vaccines: Had my Moderna after Pfizer. Had a brutal couple of days with fever, muscle ache, headaches and an upset stomach. Not sure if it was just the second dose or the mixing that caused that. #ThisIsOurShot	Moderna	Negative	Headache,Muscle Pain,Fever,Other
I was similar, felt a little under the weather but not an insane fever or anything. If you had Pfizer / moderna it's likely you haven't been exposed to covid if you have no reaction. The second vaccine apparently hits harder	Pfizer

Was in bed for an entire day with extreme fatigue after my 2nd dose of Moderna. However, the 3rd, which I received on Dec 27 went just fine! Just some VERY light tiredness & body aches, gone within a few hours. Fully vaccinated may mean boostered in the future, keep that in mind.	Moderna	Positive	Tiredness,Muscle Pain

It is not as effective as the mRNA vaccines (Moderna, Pfizer) but only requires 1 dose. But it is as effective as your typical Flu vaccine, and will reduce severity significantly if you do get sick (like Flu Vaccines). Don't take it if you are prone to blood disorders.	Pfizer

All 3 are good vaccines. I had Moderna. No side effects for 1st or 2nd shot (just sore arm), except I did feel like napping after the 1st shot. Of course, J&J requires only one shot! Experts say 2/3 of people experience no side effects, regardless of vaccine brand.	Moderna	Positive	Tiredness

Got my Moderna booster today. Okay naman except ngalay lang ang braso ko. Hot compress ba or cold compress?	Moderna	Negative	Muscle Pain
Ever since I had covid last year I've been dealing with fatigue and headaches. It wasn't until a few weeks after receiving the 2nd Moderna vaccine that those symptoms went away. I have a cold now since I haven't been wearing my mask, so I'm back to wearing a mask.	Moderna	Positive	
1st shot - sore arm 2nd shot - sore arm, slight fever 24hrs. later then fine after that. These were what most of what my friends and I experienced when we received our Moderna vaccines.	Moderna	Negative	Muscle Pain,Fever
Everyone’s symptoms are different I had Covid back April and had got the Moderna vaccine like 2 weeks ago and I felt fine. Most people say the second dose is what makes them feel sick	Moderna	Positive	
Sore arm from my Moderna booster yesterday but otherwise feeling okay!	Moderna	Negative	Muscle Pain
Had my Moderna booster last week .... just a sore arm. It was sorer than 1 & 2 shots but tolerable.	Moderna	Negative	Muscle Pain
Hi! Sorry to barge in! Got third Pfizer dose two months ago. Got sore arm, night sweats and low fever for a couple of days. After that everything has been awesome. Good luck!!!	Pfizer	Negative	Muscle Pain,Fever

I had a Moderna booster. My left arm was sore for 2 days, the soreness radiated to the lower arm as well, the feeling was similar to post-exercise soreness. No fever. Completely gone after 48 hrs. But some of my colleagues had high fever.	Moderna	Negative	Muscle Pain,Fever
Fine after first, slight headache after second (both Pfizer), totally fine after Moderna booster	Pfizer	Negative	Headache

I get a gov’t-sponsored AstraZeneca on July 1. I plan to inquire at my hospital when I get the jab, if I can get a booster shot later with a more preferred vaccine. Willing to pay for it, of course.	AstraZeneca	Positive	
Ate at Poblano Burrito to clear my sinuses. I don’t feel a fever and no sore throat. Should I hold off on retesting? Or should I consider getting the Pfizer booster at some point in case the Moderna booster? Because John actually got sick with his Pfizer booster that they offered	Pfizer	Negative	No Details
Except for a slightly sore arm, I felt just fine after both of my Pfizer vaccines.	Pfizer	Negative	Muscle Pain
I felt stoned for about 6 hour after my Moderna booster. And I had a sore arm for a few days. No other symptoms.	Moderna	Negative	Muscle Pain
I did that because moderna was the only available booster. I had101 fever last night and horrible chills and headache. (12 hrs after booster)Every 4 hours the chills come back. My headache is milder today.I’ve been taking 6 hour Tylenol. Still glad I got booster.	Moderna	Negative	Headache,Chills,Fever
Aside from this migraine, shot 2 of Pfizer has been fine. My joints ached when I first woke up but it faded fast. None of the exhaustion or aches of shot 1. Just took Nurtec for the first time so we'll see how it fairs.	Pfizer	Negative	Tiredness,Muscle Pain
I got the Pfizer vaccination all I got was a sore arm for 3 days and very very tired which vaccine did you get?	Pfizer	Negative	Tiredness,Muscle Pain

Ragazza del bar di quartiere dove andavo abitualmente, non la vedevo da un po' in giro. le chiedo tutto bene? lei: insomma dopo due dosi di Pfizer ho avuto covid e un polmone compromesso, ho sempre affanno, mia sorella pericardite, le hanno fatto esenzione. 23 anni. tutto ok.	Pfizer	Negative	Other
I only felt tired with foggy brain and had a sore arm! I also got the Moderna vaccine.	Moderna	Negative	Muscle Pain
I slept for a few hours--I think? But I'm feeling a little better. Less tired. But this is Day 2...so I'm still not sick. I think the first shot kicks your butt (if you're taking the Moderna vaccine), the second one just leaves you wiped out and tired.	Moderna	Negative	Tiredness
Two days ago I had my first Astra Zeneca vaccine. I had some chills for some hours but I feel great!	AstraZeneca	Negative	Chills
Life long post viral fatigue i now have with neurological stuff going on after my second pfizer jab would be a good one. I was training for a half marathon before i had it. Perfectly healthy. And, before you say anything it's confirmed by two doctors it was the jab that caused it	Pfizer	Negative	Other
why is everyone saying their second pfizer shot was bad i got mine and i felt completely fine. my arm was a bit sore (that’s standard with getting the vaccine) but other than that i felt normal	Pfizer	Positive

I just got my moderna booster and I felt yucky for about 36 hours. Not as bad as my first shot, but worst than the second dose. Aches and super sleepy. Still mildly achy but much better today!	Moderna	Negative	Tiredness,Muscle Pain
Done with my second dose of #AstraZeneca vaccine No nasty reaction this time just a slight sore arm overnight. Thank you #NHS	AstraZeneca	Positive	
We both got the Pfizer vaccine. Our 2nd shots where on May 1. She's doing okay now neither one of us can taste or smell still, and I'm still trying to kick the fatigue, other than that we're doing okay.	Pfizer	Negative	Tiredness
I got vaccinated with Sinovac btw, which is apparently performing better than expected in real-life evaluations. Covid vaccine side effects are: 15mins after: nothing noted 1hr: slight headache 2.5hrs: headache, pain at injection site Overall feeing great in the first few hours	Sinovac		Headache,Muscle Pain
Thanks guys, I've had 2 Astra Zeneca jabs and the Moderna booster. For me I had head ache for about 5 days, bit of a sore throat, cold like symptoms, a bit phlegmy and literally felt really fatigued. The missus had head aches, hot and cold sweats, fatigued, then after ....	Moderna

Yeah I got my vaccine 2 days before you. My headaches didn’t stop until the 1st/2nd week of May. I was in hospital and had CT and bloods done which were all clear but AZ were investigating further with my GP but have not heard anything back as of yet so am chasing up.	AstraZeneca	Negative	Headache

Yes, Ma'am. And thank you!! Yes, happy 58th! I had an anaphylactic reaction to the Pfizer vaccine and ended up in the ER on an antihistamine and steroid drip. It was JUST like Christmas Eve, when I got sick from wasabi. But no epinephrine today, thank the Lord. It has been a day.	Pfizer	Negative	Other
Tested (+) Monday. Headache, Fever, Sinuses, light fatigue for 36hrs. Pfizer X 3. If I continue this trajectory I should be back to normal in a day or so. Tested (-) NYE, ate dinner at in/outdoor rest. w/ friends, one of which is (+) also. Thanks Scientists! Could have been worse	Pfizer	Negative	Headache,Fever
Great news. I had moderna. Understand that I am highly reactive to vaccines since childhood. Arm sore and fatigue after each shot. But nothing crazy.	Moderna		Tiredness,Muscle Pain
I, too, was vaccinated a few months ago. I got both Pfizer jabs, no side effects other than mild chills and headache for a day. It felt just like the flu vaccine.	Pfizer	Negative	Headache,Chills
Hi there, I hope you’ll reconsider In future. (I do sympathise, as I have to have a flu jab every year). I had 3 Pfizer jabs for covid, and the first was definitely worst in that regard - better than being very sick and ending up in hospital though. Hope you feel better soon.	Pfizer	Negative	Other
I took 2 jabs against my better judgement due to coercion. Currently in line for a suite of blood tests after 5 weeks of chest pain. Early forties, male, Moderna. Freedom of choice is essential.	Moderna	Negative	No Details

If it's Moderna, I had a couple of crappy days afterwards, but then I was good! Everyone I know who got Pfizer was fine. Sore arm, tired and nothing else.	Moderna	Negative	Tiredness,Muscle Pain
Shot 1 in the books and other than a very slight sore spot at injection site, no issues at all. Got Pfizer and had the great fortune of having a pediatric nurse administer it. Fl drive up clinic was fantastic. Feeling so grateful. Easy peasy. Get the jab!!	Pfizer	Positive

How was the Pfizer vaccine? Husband & I had to wait for the VA, but Moderna barely made our arms sore either time. I've heard that some were sick, esp. from one-dose type.	Moderna	Negative	Muscle Pain
I got the Moderna vaccine and the only problem I had was a little soreness in my arm. Pretty much the same as with any other shot. No problems at all.	Moderna	Negative	Muscle Pain
My booster was a full dose of Moderna. I actually had doubts for a few hours that she'd in fact given me the shot. Started to feel twinges at about 12 hours. Tenderness--like a sore muscle--peaked at about 24 hours. Still a bit tender: just the deltoid, but the whole deltoid.	Moderna	Negative	Muscle Pain
I got the Moderna vaccines and got a pretty terrible case of Covid. My mom is vaccinated AND boosted and she got Covid too. I'm guessing we should be greatful for the vaccine since none of us landed in the hospital and MOST had mild cold like symptoms.	Moderna	Negative	Other
I got the moderna vaccine. I barely felt the needle, I was super surprised and so pleased. The next 2 days I was fatigued and had headaches off and on and a small amount of arm tenderness. But its the third day now and minus the sore arm, I feel back to myself again :)	Moderna	Negative	Headache,Tiredness

Ok but did anyone who got both Covid vaccines (I got Moderna but idk if Pfizer might do this too) have arm/shoulder pain more than 2 weeks after the second shot? My pain went away p quickly initially but now it feels like it’s back and I feel like I’m going crazy?	Moderna	Negative	Muscle Pain

Pfizer, mine. I'm pretty sure they caught a nerve, because the injection itself was pretty sore, and I'm normally not bothered by them.	Pfizer	Neutral	
Still have a fever - it was up to 102.1 yesterday. I’m guessing I caught COVID despite a negative RAT and three Moderna shots. It sucks when you know you can’t get a PCR and don’t want to go into any healthcare facility. Over the counter meds and rest is my remedy.	Moderna	Negative	Fever

Just did Moderna II on Tuesday. Worst I had was general fatigue and a sore arm and by Thursday I was fine. Honestly it didn’t even keep me from exercising on Tuesday and Wednesday.

I had expected the second shot to make me feel sicker than the first one did, I didn’t. Aside from a huge bruise (the nurse musta hit a vein) which was worse than the first shot, I didn’t feel sick. Not even one tiny bit. #GetVaccinated #PfizerVaccine	Pfizer	Negative	Nausea
Vaccines are 100% worth it.

I know how necessary the booster was, & I'm glad I got it, but I'm still paranoid about all the side-effects I heard connected to Moderna.
